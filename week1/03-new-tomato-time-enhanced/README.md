TomatoTime Website

About this project:

This project is a simple website that I built using HTML and CSS as part of my assignment. The goal was to practise building a page with a proper structure, navigation, and sections with background images and text on top. I tried to make the layout look similar to the TomatoTime example and also added an About page.



What I managed to do:

In this project, I:

Used proper HTML structure like header, nav, main, sections, and footer.

Used Flexbox to arrange the navigation menu.

Added background images and placed text on top of them using CSS positioning.

Created different sections for tomatoes, timers, and tote bags.

Added an About page.

Added a back-to-top button and smooth scrolling.

Added hover effects for buttons and icons.

Added social media icons in the footer.



What was a bit difficult:

One thing I struggled with in this project was getting the layout and spacing to look right, especially when placing text on top of the background images. It took me a while to understand how relative and absolute positioning work together, and I had to try a few times before the text sat in the right place on each section. I also found it a bit tricky to make the navigation and sections line up neatly using Flexbox at first, but after some practice and small adjustments, it started to make sense.



What I learned from this:

This project helped me understand how to structure a webpage properly using semantic HTML and how to use Flexbox for layout. I also learned how to use background images, how to position elements using CSS, and how to organise a small multi-page website.



Final thoughts:

I am happy with how the website looks now and I think it meets the main requirements of the assignment. If I had more time, I would improve the design more and make it look even better on different screen sizes.
