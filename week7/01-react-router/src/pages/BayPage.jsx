        Bay windows are a type of window that protrudes outward from the main
        walls of a building, creating a bay or alcove inside. They typically
        consist of three or more panels, with the center panel being larger than
        the side panels. Bay windows can add architectural interest and provide
        additional space and natural light to a room.
